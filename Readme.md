# Safe Mode

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that adds a configuration toggle to disable all impulse Logix from functioning, so you can use your inspector without Logix being able to do anything. 

Intended to be used as a way to be able to clean your avatar from any viruses that you could had saved from a public session (looking at you Tailroot -.-)
### Enabling this mod in public worlds might break various world systems like avatar culling, and anything that executes impulses from you

#### Other people can still execute impulses and make things happen, just your client will not be able to run any impulses
